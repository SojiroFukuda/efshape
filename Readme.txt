About
This is the python-based GUI software for elliptic Fourier and Principal component analysis.
You can analyze binarized images by this software.
To open the GUI, please open the fpsanalyzer.py and build it.
Free to distribute but without any warranty.
The paper of this method is still not published (I am trying hard).

In both cases, firstly, you have to make a clone of this Git ropository in your laptop.
For instance, using command tool, type like bellow

> git clone https://github.com/SojiroFukuda/FPS-PCA-GUI

In the case of the way to use command tools, move to the cloned folda by

> cd FPS-PCA-GUI

and then, execute following command

> python setup.py install

Finally, you can buid GUI by following command. 

> python efshapegui.py
